# Employee Tracker

I developed this project to create an interface that makes it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. This interface is known as a Content Management System. With this application, my challenge was to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using Node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## MVP
  
Built a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

## Bonus

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
